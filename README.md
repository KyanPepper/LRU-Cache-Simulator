## Overview

The LRU Cache Simulator is a C program that emulates the behavior of a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache memory system. This simulator takes memory access traces generated by Valgrind as input, simulating the cache hit/miss behavior and outputting total counts for hits, misses, and evictions.

## Features

- **Dynamic Cache Initialization**: Users can specify cache parameters such as:
  - **Cache Offset**: Bits used to address data within a cache line.
  - **Index Bits**: Bits used to index into cache sets.
  - **Number of Cache Lines**: Configurable cache size for various simulations.

- **Iterative Processing**: The simulator processes memory access instructions one line at a time using an iterator pattern, accommodating files of unknown sizes efficiently.

- **Performance Statistics**: Tracks key metrics such as hits, misses, and evictions, allowing users to analyze the cache's performance under different configurations.

## How to Run

To run the simulator, follow these steps:

1. **Environment Setup**: Ensure you are using a Linux environment. The simulator is not tested on WSL or Windows.

2. **Compile the Program**:
   make clean
   make
   run ./cachesim -h (this will give instructions for other command line arguments)
   feel free to experiment with the arguments but you can find examples in the pa1_documentation.pdf for examples
